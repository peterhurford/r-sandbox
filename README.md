# The R Sandbox

The R Sandbox allows one to run arbitrary R computations in the cloud.  It's good
for demoing R software.

The R sandbox was built by modifying robertzk's [R tutorial engine](https://github.com/robertzk/tutorial-engine), which is built ontop of robertzk's [microserver](http://github.com/robertzk/microserver), which is built ontop of RStudio's [httpuv](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv), which is built ontop of Joyent's [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv).  Isn't open source cool?
